# Hello-world

## Who says hello to world?

* A brief description a bout myself

My name is Alireza. I am a graduate of architecture. As I have a dream to be a different architecture, I have decided to study construction management for my Ph.D. that will help me to extend my knowledge on other related areas to architecture such as energy and technology.

* What did I do?

After my graduation, I have decided to have my own company; so, I did a numerous architectural projects in different fields from building planing to interior design.

* Any issues or challenges

My main issue is the missing of the two seissions of the class that made me a little worry to catch up the class.
